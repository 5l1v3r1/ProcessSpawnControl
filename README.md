# Process Spawn Control

Process Spawn Control is a Powershell tool which aims to help in the behavioral (process) analysis of malware.  
Process Spawn Control suspends newly launched processes and gives the analyst the option to either keep the process suspended or to resume it, allowing the process to run.

By using this tool, an analyst can slow down the execution chain and let a malware dropper drop the payload without giving it the ability to execute it. Additionally, this tool can be used to help in the analysis of malware which injects itself into a newly spawned process.

### Technical details
Process Spawn Control (PsC) uses _Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)_ to asynchronously get events about newly started processes. If the process is not configured 
to be ignored, PsC will try to suspend the process by calling the Windows _NtSuspendProcess API_. If the suspension succeeds, a GUI popup is shown to the user. For each
new process, the process' commandline and parent process is shown.  

Limitations:  
Because PsC relies on WMI to get information about newly spawned processes, it will not be able to suspend extremely _short-lived processes_ (processes which only execute for a split second, e.g. Windows' _whoami.exe_). PsC is not involved in the process creation logic, it relies on 
WMI events which are only generated once the process has already been launched. There are methods to get synchronously involved in the process creation logic (e.g. by using the _PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine kernel API_), but this is out of scope for this Powershell tool :-).


# Demo use case 1: execute an Emotet Office dropper step by step

When analyzing an Office dropper, an analyst sometimes has the desire to quickly see the behavior of the Office dropper, without giving the dropper the ability to drop its payload
and to infect the analysts sandbox environment. Below is an example of an Emotet dropper which spawns a heavily obfuscated commandline, which in its turn spawns a Powershell instance.
The Powershell instance downloads the Emotet malware in the users temp folder. The Emotet malware runs and spawns a new instance of itself.  

If you frequently want to dynamically analyse the commandlines generated by Office droppers, I recommend using [CMD Watcher](http://www.kahusecurity.com/posts/cmd_watcher_and_maldocs.html), a tool which is dedicatedly build for this purpose.

# Demo use case 2: assist unpacking a packed Azorult information stealer

Malware is frequently protected by packers which inject a payload into a legitimate process. The injected content is either an intermediate component (e.g. another packer) or the original malware.
An analyst might be interested to dump the injected process to disk or to attach a debugger to it. The lifespan of the injected process is sometimes too short to perform such an action, in which case Process Spawn Control may be of help by suspending the process. 
Suspending the process freezes its execution and prevents it from terminating quickly.  

Below is an example of a packed instance of the Azorult information stealer. The packer injects Azorult into _vbc.exe_. Azorults execution starts by connecting to a command-and-control server to fetch instructions (this behavior is documented really well in 
[Palo Altos blog on Azorult](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2018/11/unit42-new-wine-old-bottle-new-azorult-variant-found-findmyname-campaign-using-fallout-exploit-kit/)). If the connection to the C2 is unsuccessful, Azorult terminates quickly.
In the case of an unsuccessful C2 connection, the execution happens so fast that one doesn't have the time to manually dump the _vbc.exe_ process to disk. By using Process Spawn Control, an analyst can suspend the execution of _vbc.exe_, allowing him to take his time to interact with it.
